# Changelog - Development stage.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- Canvas image reference tool:
    - New toolbar Image tool with upload/replace/clear UI and draggable boxes (max 5).
    - Live preview outline while drawing image boxes.
    - Image refs are included in frame snapshots and generation prompts so generated UIs place similar images in the same positions.
- Code button surfaced in Generated UI card:
    - Added visible Code action to copy/download TSX for generated designs.

### Changed

- Auth experience styling locked to dark hero imagery:
    - Sign-in and sign-up pages use static dark hero photos with glassmorphic dark forms.
    - Copy emphasizes welcoming new users to LUMO Studios.
    - Google OAuth button restyled (white pill, dark label) for better contrast.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- Auto-save for project sketches and generated UIs:
    - Implemented projects:updateProjectSketches Convex mutation to persist canvas state.
    - Added logging to confirm saves.

### Fixed

Convex runtime issues:
- Buffer is not defined in Convex functions:
    - Removed Node-only Buffer usage or added an appropriate polyfill so Convex code runs in its expected environment.

- Uncaught Error: Not authenticated in projects:getProject after sign-out:
    - Gated project queries behind auth checks.
    - Ensured the frontend does not call protected queries after auth:store reports type: signOut.

### Changed

- Adjusted workspace box styling on dashboard to align with the canvas toolbox aesthetic in light mode:
    - Started from class="rounded-xl border bg-card p-6".
    - Updated background, border, and text/shadow to match the toolbox card style (smoother border, subtle shadow, theme-aware colors).

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- Global dark/light mode wiring for:
    - Dashboard, canvas toolbox, and other windows.
    - Ensured that the main sliding workspace/toolbox panel on the right respects both themes.

- Added extra importance to include contextual image generation while generating UI from canvas.

### Fixed

- Theme-specific styling issues:
    - Label text which was always white even in light mode now uses neutral text classes that adapt to theme.
    - Adjusted bottom canvas toolbar classes:
        - fixed the relevant div classes.
        - Ensured it overlays correctly and looks consistent in both themes.

    - Fixed z-index issues where expanded menus fell behind the canvas toolbox bar by increasing their z- class or reordering stacking context.

- Cleared the ƒ?oMissing <html> and <body> tags in the root layoutƒ?? runtime error.
- Rectified rogue script tags which were causing rendering problems.
- Fixed User profile picture not loaded properly.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- Initial production release.
- Core app shell and routing.
- Project scaffolding (Next.js, Convex, Tailwind, etc.).
- Basic layout and theme setup.
- Initial API endpoints for testing.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- Subscription tiers UI:
    - STARTER / PRO / ENTERPRISE (or equivalent) with:
        - Monthly price.
        - Generation limits and feature bullets.

- ƒ?oChoose planƒ?? buttons wired to a checkout handler (stub integration with billing).

### Fixed

- 400 Bad Request issues in the checkout flow by:
    - Ensuring the correct plan/price identifiers are passed to the backend / billing SDK.
    - Adjusting props and handler signatures in src/components/buttons/checkout/index.tsx so TypeScript types match real usage.

- Type errors in checkout/index.tsx (prop types, async handlers, etc.) flagged by the IDE after refactor.
